Android Stealth
===============

This application provides a platform for secure hidden storage of user data on an Android phone.
The application is hidden on the phone, only to be found with the correct PIN access code, and data managed by the application is encrypted and hidden from other applications on the phone.

Furthermore, the application can be shared directly between two Android phones via a WiFi hotspot, BlueTooth, and Android Beam (when available).

Project Vision
--------------

The application aims to provide a secure platform for the user to store sensitive data.
The user, and only the user may unlock, view and share the data managed (encrypted and hidden) by the application.

Near-future goals
-----------------
Create a user-friendly data management experience. 
That is, provide an intuitive, smooth flow around locking and hiding data from other applications on the phone, or other users of the phone. In addition to this:
* A 'safety net' for the user, by providing notifications; for example when files have been left unlocked.
* Direct phone-to-phone sharing of the application itself.
* Allowing users to 'morph' the application by renaming it and choosing a custom icon.

Far-future goals
----------------
Connecting the application to other (non-internet) means of communicating data.
