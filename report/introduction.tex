Smartphones are increasingly common all over the world.
Every day they are used to communicate, take pictures, game, etc.
Just like desktop and laptop computers are being used.
For many people a Smartphone is their primary computing device.
So amongst all the activities we do with these devices there are some that we would like to keep private for one reason or another.
After all it contains large parts of our lives.

Easy sharing of data, digital assistants, and many more features of smartphones lets users give others access to the data on the phone, be they people or software.
The choice to share in these cases is up to the user which is where it differs quite a bit from physically passing around a smartphone.
There are a great many reasons to still physically hand over a phone.
From letting someone take part in a phone call, letting them play a game, view vacation photographs, etc.
After handing over the phone the owner of the smartphone has very little control over what is done and how it gets used.
Aside from physically intervening in the handling of the smartphone or relying on social norms.

That is if the owner of the Smartphone even realises a search is happening and it is possible to intervene.
After all, the device's screen might not be in view of the owner at all time or in some cases certain organisations may demand to search your phone.
For these kinds of situations it is desirebly to have the option of hiding things like private photographs or sensitive documents.

In this paper we will describe one solution for accessible hiding of data, including an open source implementation for the Android OS.
