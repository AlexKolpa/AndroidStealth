\subsection{Sharing DroidStealth}
As expressed in the section \ref{sec:problem-description}, the application should be able to be shared nomadically.
This means there is no central distribution point, but users share the application between each other. 

Sharing the application is possible through a multitude of ways on Android, via all standard file sharing methods.
These methods include sending the application package through, for example, email, MMS, and BlueTooth.
DroidStealth also supports sharing via a more recently provided feature called Near Field Communication (NFC)\cite{website:nfc-spec}. 
When available on the device, it uses Android's NFC sharing feature called Android Beam to transfer the application to another device when it is held adjacent to the sending device.

These sharing methods allow the users to share DroidStealth directly from device to device, eliminating a central distribution point.
