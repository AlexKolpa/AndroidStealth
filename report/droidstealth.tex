\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{W}{ith} the rising use of smart phones in daily life and
exceptional events means sensitive data is commonly available on phones.
These pictures, videos, and in some cases other files are very interesting
to a wide variety of groups. And sometimes the standard protections on
the phone are not enough to keep those groups out. Just slide the screen
and full access to everything. Even if there things like a password or
unlock patterns these can be forced out of a person. Followed by a simple
search through the phones files by hand to find what they desire.

We call such non-technical searches of devices 'casual search.' The
person performing it will have varying degrees of expertise regarding
the workings of smartphones but is limited to the tools already available
on the phone to check out data. Instead of performing advanced attacks
using specialized tools designed to get all the data out of a phone.

This project aims to address only the issues with casual search through
the use of an Android app. The tool-aided expert attacks are not within the
scope of this project.

This paper starts with explaining the problem description in section \ref{sec:problem-description}, wherein the problem that led to the setup of this project is expanded upon.
Next, the approach taken to this problem is discusssed in section \ref{sec:approach-and-design}.
Once the approach has been determined, a description of the actual implementation can be provided, which is done is section \ref{sec:implementation}.
Finally, the limitations and future work will be discussed in section \ref{sec:future-work}.
