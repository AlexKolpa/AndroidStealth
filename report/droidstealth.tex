\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{W}{ith} rising use of smart phones in daily life and
exceptional events means there is a lot more data available on phones.
These pictures, videos, and in some cases other files are very interesting
to a wide variety of groups. This might be because oppresive governments
want to suppress this data at checkpoints around protests or random
searches on the street, or even individuals with authority pressuring
to hand over the phone to grab/remove data themselves. There are many
instances of law enforcement officers oversteppin their legal bounds
to remove images of actions they don't want recorded or because of
mistaken ideas about the law. 

We call such non-technical searches of devices 'casual search.' The
person performing it may have varying degrees of expertise regarding
the workings of mobile computing devices but is limited to the tools
already available on the phone to check out data. Instead of performing
advanced attacks using specialised tools designed to get all the data
out of a phone. 

This project aims to address only the casual searches with an Android
app rather than the latter. Which is nearly impossible to defend against
if enough time and effort is expended. This is done by providing more
control over private data in these situations. It allows users to
lock and hide their content, without inhibiting the sharing whenever
they have the desire to do so. Yet remain difficult to detect even
to those who know of its existence.

\textbf{Bla bla bla structure of paper and what we're going to discuss
where.}


\section{Problem Description}

As mobile computing becomes ubiquitous and takes the place as the primary
computing platform for many the security of these devices is paramount.
While mobile operating systems have learned a lot from traditional computing
system security there are still many gaps to be exploited. In particular the
human factor. Encryption, passwords, and other heavy security measures are 
not the standard at the moment of writing. They are generally available but
rarely used. In part becuase of their limitations. Even widely used protections
like pattern unlock have their own issues with predictable patterns and smudge
attacks.

But this is not the main issue. While the above can make access easy, not all
environments are friendly towards all kinds of data. While this is generally
associated with oppressive regimes law enforcement in many 'free' countries
have been overstepping their bounds when it comes to mobile devices. In
some cases this is even systematic. Removing videos and photos of public 
spaces involving the officers or spot checks of device contents have been
occuring. Often without the need for technical intervention or permission
from the device owner, in part because of the above. As such this would be
casual search of the devices.

Taking that into account, together with the fact that in some cases people
are required to unlock their computing devices, there needs to be a way to
safeguard data from such situations. Which means the data integrity needs
to be preserved so it can still be accessed after the incident. But in some
cases just having people be aware of the data, and who is holding it, can
cause issues for the owners. So having control over who sees the data is
another crucial aspect.

A way to achieve that for casual search is by hiding the data on the device.
Preferably as it is being made. If it is not in places where it can be seen
by looking over the device it preserves data integrity, and by making it
only accessible to those who know the secret. Either of the data location
and of encryption key.

Of course this should minimally impede the ability to access and share the
data. Assuming that internet access is limited or monitored. Direct transfer
methods like bluetooth, wi-fi direct, and of course sharing to other apps,
can be utilised to achieve this.

\section{Design and software architecture}

Here we say stuff about the libraries and intents because why reinvent
the wheel.

Data sharing and application sharing.


\section{Implementation}

How did we create the data vault. Encryption, thumbnails, notifications
for unlocking.

What the hell do we do to make morphing possible.


\section{Future Work}

bla bla, unlimited naming for morphed apps. (UTF-8, length limits?
Byte length indicator start of manifest and length of name field.)

Sharing, invisible widget

Locking files on timer or detecting if app that was opened on intent
is closed/home buttoned. Since that leaves stuff open.
