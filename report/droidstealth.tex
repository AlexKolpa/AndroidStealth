\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{W}{ith} the rising use of smart phones in daily life and
exceptional events means sensitive data is commonly available on phones.
These pictures, videos, and in some cases other files are very interesting
to a wide variety of groups. And sometimes the standard protections on
the phone are not enough to keep those groups out. Just slide the screen
and full access to everything. Even if there things like a password or
unlock patterns these can be forced out of a person. Followed by a simple
search through the phones files by hand to find what they desire.

We call such non-technical searches of devices 'casual search.' The
person performing it will have varying degrees of expertise regarding
the workings of smartphones but is limited to the tools already available
on the phone to check out data. Instead of performing advanced attacks
using specialized tools designed to get all the data out of a phone.

This project aims to address only the issues with casual search through
the use of an Android app. The tool aided expert attacks are not within the
scope of this project. As this is a very different kind of problem.

\textbf{Bla bla bla structure of paper and what we're going to discuss
where.}

\section{Design and software architecture}

Here we say stuff about the libraries and intents because why reinvent
the wheel.

Data sharing and application sharing.


\section{Implementation}

How did we create the data vault. Encryption, thumbnails, notifications
for unlocking.

What the hell do we do to make morphing possible.


\section{Future Work}

There are several aspects of the application than can be improved. Which
can be categorized under one of the following: usability, and morphing.
The categories will be discusses individually as they are separated both
technically and conceptually. 

\subsection{Usability}

In terms of usability there has been no formal study on what aspects of
the application work work well. However informal testing has shown several
avenues of improvement. First is how to access the application. 

While the freely chosen app name and icon do suffice there are other ways 
it could be done. Namely the widgets available to android users. This could 
be a simple widget mimicking the standard available widgets, or even be 
invisible. So as to have no recognizable screen space. While it could still
react to certain use patterns. A first implementation of this functionality is
available but needs to be properly evaluated.

Once the application has been started there are still some ways the user
needs to be observant in how she uses the application. As it can result in
inadvertent data breaches. Mainly when the data is opened in other apps.
While several solutions have been discussed, like listening to home button
presses or having files only be unlocked for limited time, these still need
to be explored in depth.

\subsection{Morphing}

When it comes to morphing there are two major limitations, app renaming
and software integrity validation. The first pertains to limitations in the renaming
of the application when morphing. The second holds that there is no way
to guarantee that the application hasn't been modified after morphing.

When it comes to naming there is a functional limitation in the length
of the new name as of now.
It has to be the same length or shorter than the original name length,
which can be padded with whitespace. But as of yet the way android
manifests are encoded are opaque enough that not all size indicators
have been correctly identified.

The other component of of naming is the package name staying consistent
across morphs. This is not relevant for casual search in most situations
however there is one exception, ff the application is on an appstore. As
apps are identified there by package name this would make it easy to
reveal the presence of the app. Just by searching for it on the appstore.
Currently the only solution is to not be available on appstores.

The integrity validation is currently something that does not exist with
morphing. The application needs to be signed with the same key
before morphing as after morphing. This makes it possible to distribute
updates in a nomadic manner. But also means the signing key is packaged
with the application itself for it to work. As such anyone can create a
modified version of the application and spread that as an 'update.'
Solving this problem is non-trivial and requires more research.

However initial exploration of this issues has pointed us in the direction
of a second signer application that verifies the code based on other
indicators, e.g. hash. This would then produce the application and
preferably uninstall itself. As this would allow the signer app to be
on a appstore without revealing the presence of the application. Then 
all updates would have to happen through instances of this application.
This all needs to be properly designed and verified however.
