\subsection{Vulnerability Analysis}
\label{sec:vulnerability-analysis}
\todo{Expand and move sections here.}
DroidStealth has some vulnerabilities, which are analysed here.
Per vulnerability, we explain how it poses a risk, how big the risk is, and if applicable how this could be solved.

\subsubsection{Unlocked Files}
A potential security threat that can be exploited, is that
unlocked files are stored on the internal SD card of the device,
and that another app could constantly watch the folders in which
those files would be decrypted. Then this other app could save
them somewhere else or send them over the Internet.

Also, if files are unlocked, and the user's device is taken from
its rightful owner without warning, then the user might not have
gotten enough time to press the notifications to swiftly lock
the secret files back. Invaders won't be able to see the data
directly, unless they launch a file browser and start searching,
but they would be informed of the existence of secret files.
This could be a potential danger, because an attacker could be
interested in those files and do the user harm to get these
files. Users should be fully aware that they should only unlock
files if they are 100\% sure that they are in a safe location.
